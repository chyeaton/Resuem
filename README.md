# Ada Developers Academy  

### Resume of Chy Eaton  

I'm a hopeful applicant to Seattle's Ada Developer's Academy. I've long enjoyed playing with the behind-the-scenes code, but haven't had the chance seriously pursue software development. As my Grams would say, "Chy, it's time to sh!t or get off the pot." I'm taking this passion to the professional leagues, and applying to Ada Developers Academy will be my first step. 

**Brain, don't fail me now!**
